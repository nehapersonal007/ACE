# Class 2
- NSE has around 2000 companies and BSE has around 4000 companies. We should avoid stocks, which are only in BSE.

  ## Definitions
  **Equity capital** - capital, which was used to start this business  
  **Book value per share** = (Equity or share capital (6766) + cash Reserves (744456) )/ # shares (677) = 1109…. ~ 1110

  **How to calculate Debt to Eq ratio**
  Equity = Book Value * #shares
D/E ratio = Debt / Equity

Ex - Reliance
Book Value = 1110
#shares = 677 Cr
Equity = 1110 * 677 = 751470 Cr
Debt = 3,16,697 Cr.
D/E ratio = 3,16,697/751470 = .42

CLASS 4:

MKT Capitalisation = Total NO OF SHARES * MKT PRICE





44:35 - face value, BOOK value and share 



Book value / share = (share capital + reserves) / total shares
Equity = Shareholder funds = (share capital + reserves) 
Face value = share capital/total shares


Share capital means - how much money was used as capital to start that company


MKT Capitalisation = Total NO OF SHARES * MKT PRICE

ExMPLE:
BRITANNIA : check how big the company was 10 years back, so we can get how much it has grown
In 2011, 104000

104000/22(profit) = 4272 cr ( market capitalisation) — in march 2011

Now in March 2011, Britannia has net profit of 134cr which means was was at a PE of 4272 cr/ 134 cr = 35 PE

Which means  Market capitalisation of a particular year / Net profit of that year

Which means company should take 35 years to gain this much profit

But it is not so, as company has different profit every year === we can sum the net profit of every year, which shows company earned the profit in 8 years not 35 years

This means gain depends how much faster PE ratio is increasing

> If PE ration < 10 its a positive point , otherwise not bad



If ROCE> 30% then it’s great company
15-30% Above average
ROCE : compNY OTHER THAN BANK AND PSU
ROE: BANK N PSU , > 10%
